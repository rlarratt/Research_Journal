left,Poolsuite,Internet radio station,"Poolsuite is an Internet radio launched by Marty Bell and Grant MacLennan in 2019, building from Bell's 'Poolside FM' tumblr site from 2014. The Poolsuite team now includes other roles such as program designers, Computer Operator and creative consultant. The concept is really clear and well executed, everything about the interface feels retro and 'ultra-summer'.  Each part cohesively contributes to this: the navigation pixelated icons, the interactivity of pop ups throughout the site, the grain and choice of pictures for the background, the retro feeling fonts, the music. I especially enjoy the small and deliberate choices on where to include movement; like the song graph that visually moves along with the music, and the Poolsuite TV. All of it meshes together in such a satisfying way, not to mention the music is great, I've had it on multiple times while studying.

leftDoubleImage,Dear Data,Girogio Lupi and Stefanie Posavec,"A year long project between two designer friends, in which both Lupi and Posavec mailed a postcard to eachother (England to America and vice versa) each week. Each postcard was a hand-drawn data visualisation of a particular aspects of their lives that week such as laughters or the different times they felt undecided about something. I find this project so appealing not just because of how many ways they could think of to visualise data (which is pretty amazing) but also because how human it is, which I wasn't expecting a data driven project to be like. I think because of a few factors like it being between two friends, being hand-drawn but mainly because of the type of data they choose to document. Both Lupi and Posavec are honest and reflective, like when ",./img/DearData1.png,./img/DearData2.png,Stefanie's week 7 Postcard: a week of complaints,,https://www.dear-data.com/theproject,"Data, Hand-drawn, DataVisualisation",
left,Talia Cotton,Graphic Designer and Coder,"Talia Cotton is a designer working in the intersection of graphic design and coding,  and founded Cotton Design in 2023 Her generative branding systems are a particular stand out. She delivers many lectures and teaches coding at Parsons School of Design. She is passionate about the creative potential of coding and wants to teach others. I find her work exciting and makes me want to properly learn and use coding as a creative tool. Her designs are very varied, working with a wide range of  stylistic outcomes and clients including some big names like Google and The New York Times.  Her online portfolio website is very cool.

left,Vera Molnár,"Hungarian Artist, 1924-2023","Vera Molnar was creating generative art in the 60s, using algorithmic programmes to compose her works before computers. She was one of the first women to use a computer in her art, in 1968 she taught herself programming and had access to a computer which she could output to a plotter to create drawings.  I find her work so captivating, she had such a great eye to be able to form these amazing artworks out of repetition of shapes.

left,Dial-a-Poem ,"John Giorno, 1968","A service established by activist and poet John Giorno; accessible by the public through which someone could call the number and hear a piece of poetry for free. Stemmed from the desire to have poetry heard and not merely read, as well as the idea of information and art being accessible. It was then presented at MoMa in 1970. I really like the interface of the telephone, especially looking at it from 2025 where it is now has accumulated nostalgia and isn't an everyday object (although Giorno was exploiting the phone as a contemporary form of media). So far from the digital screens through which we interact with a lot of media these days, the process of dialing and the only use of the the object being a phone. I also love the content being poetry, feels at odds the  domesticised or commercialised sphere of the phone, and at a pre-digital time, how else could one hear a poem recited by the poet themselves except at an event.

left,The Library of Non Human Books,Karen ann Donnachie and Andy Simionata,"A work by Karen ann Donnachie and Andy Simionata  ,Winner of Tokyo TDC RGB award, 2020.The designs are based in the meanings in the words in the original books, extracting an interpretation from a combination of the words that may not stand out to readers. I like that the product is a physical book object, it challenges the idea that technology has to replace the physical object, as here it has created it. Draws out artistic potential and inspiration within the written words it works with  by a kind of transposing. It reminds me of artists being inspired by other works to inform their own creations. A process that I always thought of as very human.

A lot of his oeuvre looks at what the human presence is and affects, through non human mediums. His drawing robots are what he is most well known for, and the compositions created by them are quite amazing.

leftDoubleImage,Composition No.1,"Marc Saporta, 2011"," This edition was published by Visual Editions, through which other interesting book designs have emerged. The book is all loose leaf, and held together in a box and was the first book of this kind when first published in 1962. Each page is its own narrative and so the book can be read in any order, the page shuffled in any way. The reader interacts with the book in quite an abnormal way where they have a lot more autonomy and participation.  On the back of each page aredigitally generated visuals created by Salvador Plascencia and the main draw card for this book being an entry. They're mesmerising and look like topographical maps created with letters. Visual Editions has also created an app of the book designed for tablet/ipad, which capitalises on the interactivity of the story and shuffles through the pages until you tap.",./img/comp.png,./img/comp2.png,"Composition No.1, 2011 edition published by Visual Editions",Close up of generative visual by Salvador Plascencia,,"BookDesign, GenerativeTypography",
left,Life Writer,"Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau","Installation by Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau in 2006. Consists of a typewriter and a projection onto the paper being ""type"" on. The letters that are pressed are seen to be printed on to the paper but when the carriage return is pressed the letters shortly become bug looking creatures that move across the page. The letters inform code so that each character provides a different size and movement to the bug. The creatures eat other letters to stay alive and also reproduce. The page can be filled with the critters. It provides an interesting dialogue between the analogue and digital, particularly in the creative sphere.

left,Counter Forms,Type Website,"An online website that functions as a platform to showcase type designers and type discourse, founded by Dominic Hoftstede, Vincent Chan and Robert Janes. Concerned with typographic ""research, education and advocacy.  The website is lovely. It showcases type really well, with an attention to grids, following and breaking them intentionally, and has really nice simple interactivities across the site. I particularly love the type clock in the top right that constantly moves and is also a navigation to the home page and changes when you hover over. The home page also completely changes every time it is refreshed. ",./img/counter.png,,Screenshot of Counter Forms site home page,,https://counter-forms.com/,"Typography, WebsiteDesign",
